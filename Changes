2010-04-4      v0.15

  - Rewrote most of the code so as to improve quality.
  - Wrapped the entire loader in an anonymous subroutine to improve packing
    and so that you can easily rename JSAN to Just or to any other name.
  - Got rid of all the functions with dangling underscores.
  - Moved the Exporter outside of JSAN into Exporter.js
  - Added jsan.observers so that you can add plugins such as the Exporter
    into the jsan loading system.
  - Added jsan.cwd to access the current working directory of the scripting
    that is being evaluated.
